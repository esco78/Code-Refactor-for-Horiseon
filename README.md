# Code-Refactor-for-Horiseon

## Description

Included in this repository is a pair of HTMl and CSS files for the Horiseon webpage. The goal of this project was to fix errors in the files which caused some aspects of the webpage to function improperly or not at all. Aside from making sure the webpage functioned properly, another goal was to ensure the code within each file was clean and annotated properly to allow for future fixes and changes to be a simpler process. Unnecesarry or redunant code was removed as well from the CSS file and Proper semantics were added to the HTML file.
Personally, upon completing this refactoring, I learned the important of having 'clean' code as well as the importance of annotating files to allow for quick allocation of specific functions used in the webpage.
With the new refactored code, this project has allowed the Horiseon's nav bar to funcion properly. Clicking on the text in the upper-right-hand corner will jump to page to the related section. The tab on the web browser now displays 'Horiseon', as opposed to the 'webpage' it was previously titled.
