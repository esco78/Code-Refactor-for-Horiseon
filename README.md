# Code-Refactor-for-Horiseon

## Description

Included in this repository is a pair of HTMl and CSS files for the Horiseon webpage. The goal of this project was to fix errors in the files which caused some aspects of the webpage to function improperly or not at all. Aside from making sure the webpage functioned properly, another goal was to ensure the code within each file was clean and annotated properly to allow for future fixes and changes to be a simpler process. Unnecesarry or redunant code was removed as well from the CSS file and Proper semantics were added to the HTML file.
Personally, upon completing this refactoring, I learned the important of having 'clean' code as well as the importance of annotating files to allow for quick allocation of specific functions used in the webpage.
With the new refactored code, this project has allowed the Horiseon's nav bar to funcion properly. Clicking on the text in the upper-right-hand corner will jump to page to the related section. The tab on the web browser now displays 'Horiseon', as opposed to the 'webpage' it was previously titled.

## Installation

1. Have Visual Studio Code, or similar developer tool, installed on personal machine.
2. Clone 'Code-Refactor-for-Horiseon' repository using the green 'code' button in the upper right corner.Use either HTTPS or, if set up, SSH.
3. Make a copy of repository to personal machine and save to a location most suitable to oneself.
4. Open both index.html and style.css using Visual Studio Code or similar dev tool.
5. Scroll through code on both files and read through annotations to access each function for the webpage.

## Usage

* Step 5 under installation above is a good example of usage. Simply scroll through each annotated section of the html and css file to see how website functions.
* Basic programmer courtesy calls for leaving code cleaner than what is given.
* This project is a refactoring of the code to ensure Horiseon's webpage functions properly and is compatible with Search Engine Optimization. All other uses would depend on the company itself.
